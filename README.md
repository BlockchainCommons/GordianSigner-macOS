# Blockchain Commons GordianSigner-macOS

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-Catalyst/master/images/logos/gordian-signer-screen.jpg)

**Gordian Signer** allows users to participate in a multisig by adding a signature to an otherwise unsigned or partially signed PSBT, where they did not initiate the transaction. It can also be used for signing a single-signature PSBT. It's largely intended as an offline signing tool, which allows signing without the usage of a full node: a real wallet is need to both initiate an account map and to initiate a transaction.

## Additional Information

This is a companion app for the Gordian system:

* [Gordian system](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian) — A self-sovereign Bitcoin wallet and node

Gordian Signer is a multiplatform utility that's also available as:

* [GordianSigner for Android](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-Android)
* [GordianSigner for iOS](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-Catalyst)

## Status - Active Development

GordianSigner-macOS is currently under active development. It should not be used for production tasks until it has had further testing and auditing.

We expect this to be a temporary repo. We also a [Catalyst repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/GordianSigner-Catalyst), which we'd prefer to use for macOS, to totally standardize our code base, but currently we're unable to do so because of security locks on the desktop camera.

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Gordian System Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions). For users and developers of the Gordian system, including the Gordian Server, Bitcoin Standup technology, QuickConnect, and the Gordian Wallet. If you want to talk about our linked full-node and wallet technology, suggest new additions to our Bitcoin Standup standards, or discuss the implementation our standalone wallet, the Discussions area of the [main Gordian repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian) is the place.

[**Wallet Standard Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about wallet standards, please use the Discussions area of the [Airgapped Signing repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning). This is where you can talk about projects like our [LetheKit](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-lethekit) and command line tools such as [seedtool](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-seedtool-cli), both of which are intended to testbed wallet technologies, plus the libraries that we've built to support your own deployment of wallet technology such as [bc-bip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-bip39), [bc-slip39](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-slip39), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Shamir Secret Key Recovery](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur), and the [bc-crypto-base](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-crypto-base). If it's a wallet-focused technology or a more general discussion of wallet standards,discuss it here.

[**Blockchain Commons Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions). For developers, interns, and patrons of Blockchain Commons, please use the discussions area of the [Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community) to talk about general Blockchain Commons issues, the intern program, or topics other than the [Gordian System](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions) or the [wallet standards](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/AirgappedSigning/discussions), each of which have their own discussion areas.
